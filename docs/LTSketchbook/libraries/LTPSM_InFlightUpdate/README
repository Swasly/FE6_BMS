                        In-Flight-Update Library
						
This library can be used to program LTC parts with a Linduino and an ICP file 
exported from LTpowerPlay.

See InFlightUpdate PSM demo.

TODO
---------
Abstract out the get_data and init methods so that the user can specify how to 
obtain the data, and so that this library is no longer coupled with the 
LT_SDReader library.

Use
---------
Until the TODO is completed, load the file from SD that you wish to use, and 
then call program() or verify() depending on the desired function.
Program will program the NVM with new data, then load from NVM so the new 
configuration is on the part.
Verify will just read from NVM and confirm whether or not the part configuration 
matches the file.  The part NVM will not be modified.
